Cisco Configurations in TXT format

When generating Cisco configurations in TXT format, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use the appropriate command syntax for the specific Cisco device and IOS version.
2. Include all relevant configuration commands, including interface configurations, routing protocols, and access control lists.
3. Use comments to explain complex configurations or to provide context for specific commands.
4. Ensure that the configuration is properly indented and formatted for readability.
5. Test the configuration in a lab environment before deploying it to production.
